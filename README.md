#Week 8 Day 4 Homework React Router Stock App

Your stock tracking app should have the following features...

Navigation
No matter what route the user is visiting, they should always see a navigation bar at the top of the window. It should contain links to "Home" and "About" pages.

Dashboard (/stocks)
If a user visits /stocks or clicks "Home" in the navigation bar, they should be directed to a dashboard page. This page should list all of the stocks that the user is tracking, specifically their name and symbol. These stocks should be pulled from stock-data.js.
